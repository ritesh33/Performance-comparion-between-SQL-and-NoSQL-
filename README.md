# Performance-comparion-between-SQL-and-NoSQL-

Objective: The objective of this project is to compare the performance between the SQL and NoSQL. For this experiment MongoDB and MySQL is used. The performance is tested based on time require to run the query and retrieve the data, memory used to store data. The performance is also tested by comparing the amount of memory each table occupies. Due to the absence of the JOIN clauses in MongoDB, MAP-REDUCE is used to combine the data from different collections (Tables in MySQL).

Data set: The data set used for this experiment is the details of the employees, which consist of five tables and have 3 million employeesâ€™ details.
